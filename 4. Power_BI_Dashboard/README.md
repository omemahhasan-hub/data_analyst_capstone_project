### ðŸ”§ Technical Notes
- Created calculated columns (e.g., Annual Salary) for consistent financial analysis
- Designed custom DAX measures:
  - Turnover Rate: `DIVIDE(Terminated Employees, Total Employees) * 100`
  - Pay Equity Ratio: `DIVIDE([Female Avg Pay], [Male Avg Pay]) * 100`
  - Below Band Risk: `COUNTROWS(FILTER(Employees, [Salary] < [Band_Min]))`
- Implemented conditional formatting and bookmarks for executive navigation

## Data Quality & Troubleshooting

### Hidden Character Data Quality Challenge
**Problem Identified**: Performance_Score filtering inconsistencies between SQL and Power BI outputs.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Direct filters `WHERE Performance_Score = 'Fully Meets'` returned 0 rows
- GROUP BY showed category existed with 12 employees
- Investigation revealed non-breaking spaces (0xA0) and hidden Unicode characters

**Diagnostic Process**:
```sql
-- Identified the issue using LENGTH() and HEX() functions
SELECT Performance_Score, LENGTH(Performance_Score), HEX(Performance_Score)
FROM core_hr 
GROUP BY Performance_Score;
```

**Solution Implemented**:
- Applied robust filtering with `LIKE '%Fully Meets%'` and `TRIM()` functions
- Documented data cleaning requirement for production deployment
- Recommended permanent fix: `UPDATE core_hr SET Performance_Score = TRIM(REPLACE(Performance_Score, CHAR(160), ''));`

**Professional Takeaway**: Demonstrates data wrangling expertise and quality assurance methodology essential for production analytics environments.
